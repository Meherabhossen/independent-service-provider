            <p>I am Meherab Hossen.  I need to be a good developer, I established a target for myself. Im in 3rd year of my university. In the future i want to build a web-developing company, I set this goal for myself that I need to achieve. </p>
            <p>Im ensuring that my goals are clear so that I may work toward them. Instead of stating that I want to improve my interpersonal skills, that i can interact with my employ in future.</p>
            <p>Learning to set goals for myself as I work my way to the top of my profession. I can help you develop the skills and experience you believe will help your developer career grow. Set measurement as learning and aim to learn a new skill once a month.</p>
            <p>Improving the ability alone does not guarantee team satisfaction; other qualities are required. Finding the best team that shares my professional goals is critical to my success.</p>
